 This CUDA function tries to turn on every muscle that is connected to a node.
 It loops through all the muscle connected to the node with index = nodeToTurnOn.
 1: Checks to see if it really is a muscle (muscle number not equal to -1).
    and Checks to see if the muscle is on or off. If it is off it is ready to turn on. 
    There is no need to see if a muscle is dead here because if it is dead turning it on will do nothing.
    Then it: 
 	a. Sets which node turned it on so it can send the conduction signal in the proper direction. 
 	b. Sets the muscle to on.
 	c. Sets the muscle's timer to 0.0.

/*
 This CUDA function calculates all of the position-forces on a node. Most of these forces are due 
 to the muscles connected to the nodes, but one is a central outward pushing force that represents 
 the pressure from the blood in the LA. 
 
 The only other force on a node is its drag force. This is a velocity-based force and is calculated 
 in the updateNodes function. 
 
 The function's parallel structure is node-based (GridNodes, BlockNodes).
 The different type forces are explained here and numbered so the reader can see where they are applied
 below in the function.
 
 1. Central push back force:
 	If you are using a line or circle nodes and muscles file pressure does not make much sense but
 	this force is still useful. In a lines simulation it helps straighten the line out after a beat.
 	In a circle simulation it helps return the nodes out to a circle after a beat.
 	For the 3-D shell simulations we use force = pressure*area. The area of a node is calculated in the 
 	setMuscleAttributesAndNodeMasses() function. The pressure is is a linear function that starts from
 	DiastolicPressureLA when the node is a full radiusOfLeftAtrium and increases to SystolicPressureLA
 	when a node is at its contracted length of muscleCompressionStopFraction*radiusOfLeftAtrium. We also use 
 	a multiplier so the user can adjust this force to fit their needs.
 
 This next set of functions gets the forces on a node caused by a muscles at all times, not just when it
 is under contraction. It pulls back when a muscle is stretched past its natural length, pushes back when a 
 muscle is compressed past it maximal compression length, and helps restore a muscle to its natural length 
 when it is between these two values.
 
 2. Muscle is too short force: 
 	If a muscle starts to become shorter than compressionStopFraction*naturalLength it will start to push
 	back. To keep this from being an abrupt change we transition into it. This transition starts at 10% of 
 	the amount a muscle can contract with equals [0.1*(1 - compressionStopFraction)*naturalLength].
 	Note: We used the amount a muscle can contract not the compressionStopFraction because using the 
 	compressionStopFraction might make a case where the transition zone reaches past the natural length in
 	the subsequent force functions.
 	
 	This starts at the relaxed strength. The relaxed force is always on to help return a muscle to its natural 
 	length, as stated above. It cancels out the contraction strength by the time it hits the contraction stop length. 
	If d which equals the actual muscle length at this moment in time, gets shorter than the contraction stop length 
	the push back force just keeps increasing. This is accomplished in the linear function below 2..
 	
 3. Restoration force	
 	In this region the muscle is neither too short or too long. In this region we add a small push back force to help
 	the muscle return to its natural length. This is a constant force force with strength equal to the relaxedStrength 
 	which is a fraction of the contractionStrength. This function and the pressure restore the AL to it relaxed shape.
 	
 4. Approaching natural length transition force
 	As the muscle approaches its natural length we linearly transition it into having a force of zero when it reaches 
 	its natural length.

 5. Muscle too long force
	If for some reason a muscle is stretched past its natural length this function will linearly pull it back to its 
	natural length. It should be a good bit stronger than the relaxedStrength. We are not putting in a distance where 
	the muscle actually breaks. If it gets stretched that far we have bigger problems we need to address. 
	We transition into this taking it from zero to the contractionStrength in one transitionLength. Past one transitionLength 
	it will just keep increasing. We use contractionStrength and transitionLength here because they are already scaled 
	to work on this muscle.

 6. sine squared contraction force
 	This contraction force transitions from zero to full strength as time goes from zero to half the refractory period. 
 	Then goes from full strength to zero as time progresses on to the full refractory period. Here we use a sine squared 
 	function to achieve this because it smoothly transition in and out of the contraction.
 	
 7. The user can completely turn off the contraction function if they only want to watch the electrical activity across the LA 
    by setting the contractionType to zero in the simulationSetUp file.
